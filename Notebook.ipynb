    "The primary focus of this data science project is to analyze and assess features that contribute to a movie's return on investment in order to make an informed decision regarding what features of movie creation my company should invest in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Success Criteria\n",
    "The success of this project will be measured by providing three well-supported recommendations on the most cost efficient movie features (actors, directots, genre, marketing cost, movie rating (G, PG, PG-13, etc.)) to invest in. For this project, the most \"cost efficient\" features are measured by their return on investment which is defined as 100% times the total revenue divided by the initial investment of the feature."
