    "My company is looking to get into movie creation using their newly created movie studio. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Goals\n",
    "The primary focus of this data science project is to analyze and assess features that contribute to a movie's return on investment in order to make an informed decision regarding what features of movie creation my company should invest in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Success Criteria\n",
    "The success of this project will be measured by providing three well-supported recommendations on the most cost efficient movie features (actors, directots, genre, marketing cost, movie rating (G, PG, PG-13, etc.)) to invest in. For this project, the most \"cost efficient\" features are measured by their return on investment which is defined as 100% times the total revenue divided by the initial investment of the feature."

Even though the movie title is not included, each entry has an associated unique ID. Additional information is included about each entry, such as a synopsis, the movie rating, genre(s), director, writer, and runtime.\n",

    "- Rotten Tomatoes \"Movie Reviews\" dataset\n",
    "    - This dataset includes 8 features and 54432 observations/entries, where each entry in the dataset represents a different review left by a movie critic. Each entry contains an ID which refers to the movie the review is about. In addition to the review, other information for each entry includes a rating (out of 5), the critic's name, the publisher, and the date the review was left. \n",

    "- The Movie DB's \"Movies\" dataset\n",
